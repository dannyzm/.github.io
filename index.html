  <p>STEP stands for Striving Towards Educational Prosperity.
   STEP began in 2008 as a joint effort between the UNC 
   Scholars Program, the Order of the Bell Tower and 
   the N.C. Fellows to commemorate former student body 
   president Eve Carson’s commitment to service and 
   equality. The program aims to bring 5th through 9th 
   grade students of low socioeconomic status to the 
   UNC-Chapel Hill’s campus for a day during the spring 
   semester. In doing so, we hope to encourage the students 
   to believe that ANYONE can attend higher education and 
   introduce them to existing programs set up to help 
   disadvantaged students overcome the financial barriers 
   of attending college. A typical STEP day includes interactions 
   with UNC-CH professors, performances from student groups, 
   a speech from an admissions official, a tour of the 
   campus filled with games, lunch at a dining hall, 
   and a tour of the UNC basketball museum.
